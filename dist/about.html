                <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who 
                    are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded 
                    by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and 
                    equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is 
                    the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple 
                    and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when 
                    nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed 
                    and every pain avoided.
